Yesterday my new soldering gear was delivered. The previous set I bought was convenient, because it is wireless, but wasn't getting hot enough. I was struggling with getting a good connection on the boards.

This one works way better. I soldered a couple of displays earlier that didn't work. Re-soldering with this soldering station made it work in 5 minutes. Really happy with it.

I also started on my first physical radio panel, but I won't show pictures of it. I milled the panel from the wrong side :-| so that needs a do-over shortly. Slight problem with this Covid-period is that most shops are closed and I need some new material for the enclosure. Not sure when I can pick this up again. It does help with building up my patience, not one of my natural virtues...

Anyways, another small step forward.

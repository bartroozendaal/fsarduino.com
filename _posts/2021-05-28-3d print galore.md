After trying out some 3d prints in a shop, I really liked the results. I also added up the expected costs for creating all the things that I wanted printed. And, the time it takes to get something delivered (still waiting for my last test batch of printed bezels after a week), I decided to go look around for a 3D printer.

I found this little (?) beauty for a bargain at [123-3d.nl](https://www.123-3d.nl/3D-printers/Creality-3D-CR-10S-Pro-V2-p16059.html)
It was a bit of fuzz to level the bed correctly and to find the correct temperature for the filament I bought with it, but it is now printing excellently. This is the first bezel I printed. I'm making some small adjustments to the design and then will print 10 of them.

Today I decided to raise the panel to make room for moving the yoke casing behind the screen. The screen will be closer, which is closer to the real life situation I guess.

I learned along the way to try things out before applying any glue.

I had to fix the position of the yoke, thinking about all kinds of fancy cases, but I guess a wire can do the job too. If it works, it works.

The final result is much better and nicer to fly.

Tomorrow I will either work on the light switches or on the front panel for the monitor, which will have the rotary encoders for setting heading et cetera. I might also install a simple shelf for my mouse and keyboard. Until I'm completely done, I will still need that. And I won't be done for a while ;-)

Haven't made my mind up about tomorrow yet. We'll see.

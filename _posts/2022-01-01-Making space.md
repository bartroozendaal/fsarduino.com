Happy New Year to you all! My first resolution of the year was: start cleaning the cellar and create a space to work in, and later to fly in. No software or soldering to start off the year, but cleaning old stuff, spider webs, old paint and dust, dust, dust.

The wall with the boxes will be general storage (probably with boxes ;-)) and I'll create some separation sliding walls to tidy things up. On the left hand side of the picture, working around the radiator, I will create my DIY-section, with a workbench and some proper lighting.

Looking at it from the other side, you can see the space where the cockpit will be. On the left hand side of the picture there will be a 40 inch screen that I still got lying around. On the wall there will be a monitor for the right hand outside view. For the left hand view I will either create a permanent setup for a monitor, or a monitor on a swivel monitor arm, so I can fold it away. I haven't decided on that yet.

The total available area is 2.70 meters by 1.90 meters. It is not large but plenty of space for this set up I think. One slight problem is the height of the cellar: it's only about 1.70 meters. So, I cannot stand up straight.

After cleaning I will create an epoxy floor, and will put a rolling desk chair in the room. That will make it easy to clean and gives me a possibility to conveniently 'move' around. I've already got wired internet in the cellar, which is a good thing, because WiFi reception is zero.

Anyways, I'm on my way. It only took three hours today to move most rubbish out. Tomorrow the remainder of the cleaning up, vacuuming and making the final plans. I'll probably order the necessary epoxy tomorrow too, because, make hay while the sun shines! Let that be my second New Year's resolution!

Cheers, to a happy 2021!

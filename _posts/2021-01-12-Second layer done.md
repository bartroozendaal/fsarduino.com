As a seasoned (...) epoxy floor manager, I just used my lunch break to put on the second layer of epoxy coating on the cellar floor. The second time was easier than the first. I only had to walk up the stairs 4 times to pick up the stuff I forgot to bring with me, and only had to call at my family to bring some more stuff two times ;-).

This time I opted to get a bit lighter color. The previous one turned out to be a bit too dark to my tasting. I chose RAL1013, which should be something like [this color](https://rgb.to/ral/1013).

Tomorrow, when all hsa dried up, I'll post some pictures.

Yesterday I implemented a bit more of my radio panel sketch and instrument, being able to set the frequency, switch between standby and active frequency and show the results on the display on the Nano. However, yesterday was 6 jan 2021 (if you are looking at this page a considerable time after that date, look it up on Wikipedia), and I had some other things on my mind, so didn't do a lot.

Today however, I decided to not get the storage space in the cellar, but put the stuff somewhere else to get more space in the cellar. This is now a sketch of the current plans:

Tonight I will finalize the cleaning of the floor, MAYBE put the primer on if I can find the energy. I hardly got any sleep last night though, so not holding my breath. If I can do the final cleaning tonight, I will be happy

I'm getting the hang of it all a bit. I got a led, a switch plus a potentiometer connected. I didn't success with the rotary connector yet; I'm suspecting I need a capacitor connected to eliminate some noise from the rotary connector. I ordered some yesterday, so I can try that shortly.

I also resoldered the LCD display. I'm still not happy with my soldering, but I've accepted that will improve over time. This time, it worked in one go, so that's progress I guess.

The software code is builing in my head and is getting shape. I don't want to spend a lot of serious time on it just yet, because I want to wait for the WiFi boards I ordered. If all is well, they will arrive before the end of the year. I'm planning to use web sockets to transfer data between the Arduino and the integration service. Hopefully that works (and fast enough). I also ordered a Nano to build a switch and button only panel. So, much, much more to come. But not today. Christmas Eve is about to start...

Enjoy you Holidays!

I'm thinking about the layout of the cockpit. First I thought to make it completely fixed, but I will want to fly different planes. And, with a different plane comes a different layout. So, I am planning to be able to (sort of) swap out the layout of the cockpit.

There are basically two parts in the layout:

- The display, which will show the instruments, probably using Air Manager
- Two panels, with physical knobs, lcd displays, rotary encoders, switches, et cetera. Driven by Arduino's

The display will have a replaceable overlay, basically a wooden panel with holes in it :-). The monitor will display the instruments in the right place. I'm expecting the end result to give a fairly real world impression of the instrument part of the cockpit.

The switch and radio panel can also be replaced, but I'm not sure that will happen in real life. If I will have various layouts for these panels, I might, but creating a second set of these panels will be on the bottom of my backlog I think. But, I will prepare for them to be replaced, using a connector for the wiring and nice screw holes so the panels can be replaced should I want to do so.

Eventually I will want physical instruments for everything, but for now, a monitor will do quite nicely. I've seen some great setups using Air Manager, so will go with the at first.

After a day of fiddling with my code, I decided to make more use of available libraries out there. It's simply a bit too much work to do everything from scratch, which I initialy intended. After all, there needs to be a bit of time left for flying the planes.

To communicatie between de simConnect interface and the Arduino, I will use [CmdMessenger](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/cmdmessenger/). It looks the be quite extensive and very suitable for sending information back and forth.

The radio panel is showing up nicely. Next stop is setting the frequencies and swapping between the STANDBY frequency and the ACTIVE frequency. Also, switching between COM1 and COM2 of course.

Anyways, I'm properly on my way with the software development. I expect some workable results soon.

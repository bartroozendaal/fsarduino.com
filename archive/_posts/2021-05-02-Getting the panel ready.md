I decided to work on the front panel as I want to do a bit of work that shows the intended end result a bit better. First up, creating a front panel that will hold the rotary encoders and covers the screen.

I know from the first version that measuring every carefully is needed. There is not a lot margin for error and after drilling the instruments holes, the remaining wood is thin and fragile. So, careful measuring is needed.

There is no other option than to drill all the holes and hope for the best.

Practice makes perfect. Just a slight error with the slot for managing the screen, but that won't worry me too much. Looks and fits pretty good, so I'm happy.

Next up is painting and installing the rotary encoders. Also probably enforcing the thin parts of the panel a bit to make sure it won't break over time. But for now, happy as a cucumber...

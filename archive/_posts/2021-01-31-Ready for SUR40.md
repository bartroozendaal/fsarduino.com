This weekend I finished up the plasterboards and some small things to tidy up. I also checked if the SUR40 screen still works (it does) so I put up the wall mount for it. Let's hope I did my measurements correctly, because I want it (almost) tight to the ceiling.

I made quite some progress this weekend, but couldn't finish the electricity because I didn't have the right drill for the holes. That will follow coming week, as well as covering the pipes at the ceiling. Next weekend painting! (I hope)...

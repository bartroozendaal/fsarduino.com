Het is been a while since the last update. The winter and all made me spend my time outside more than inside. It's not that often that we can skate outside in the Netherlands anymore.

I did find time to put on the first coating of paint on the walls though. This week they get their final color and maybe this weekend installing the workbench/desk/table (haven't made up my mind yet). I have a couple of bids at local auctions on those; let's hope I win one.

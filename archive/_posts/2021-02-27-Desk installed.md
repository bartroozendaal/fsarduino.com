Today I installed my desk, fixed the Wifi (needs some additional fixing tomorrow) and all is ready now for getting to work and start building the cockpit. I can remote into the machine when working upstairs (this computer is way faster than my company issued machine), easily switch between the desk monitor and the SUR40.

Tomorrow finishing touches for the Wifi, cleaning up all the DIY equipment and unpacking the electronics related gear. Time to have some fun!

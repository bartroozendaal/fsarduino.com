Stage one, the rebuilding of the cellar, is complete. Apart from having the workbench in place, I can call it my office. When the last part is delivered, I can quickly assemble it and start working here.

I will start working in the cellar to get a good feel about the room, see what is missing and what needs to be updated, before I actually start building the cockpit. I expect it to be a pretty permanent installation, so don't want to rush it. I had the same approach when I just bought my house. Just sit in the room for a couple of weeks to get the right feel for it.

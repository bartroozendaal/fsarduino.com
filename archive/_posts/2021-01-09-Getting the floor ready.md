Yesterday I put on the primer for the epoxy floor I'm putting into my cellar. Today the leveling of the floor will be completed, and tomorrow this all will be finished up with the top coating. That will probably put an end to the dust that I inevitable put into my home when going into and out off my cellar. After that, I'll take on the walls.

I used products from [PolyesterShoppen](https://polyestershoppen.nl/informatie/strakke-epoxy-vloer-in-garage) which I can recommend. Friendly people, timely delivery and some helpful instructions on their site for DYI noobs like myself. Sorry, in Dutch, but that works for me ;-)

I'll add some pictures about today's progress, if anything can be seen on them that is, later on.

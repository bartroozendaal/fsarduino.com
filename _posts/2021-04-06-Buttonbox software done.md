During the long Easter weekend I worked on the software for the buttonbox and had my first proper flights with it. There is still some tinkering with the software, specifically with regards to the performance, but it works and for now that is good enough.

I'll keep flying a bit, tinker with the software, until it works good enough for me. I'm planning to add a trim wheel and maybe throttle, mixture levers. Maybe a flaps lever too. But, we'll see... First, some flying...

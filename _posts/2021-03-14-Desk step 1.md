The first step of the cockpit is ready. Again, learned a lot, and I think eventually I will redo it, but for now it is good enough. Pondering if I should paint now, of fly first. I think I will fly, paint tomorrow evening so the paint can dry. There probably isn't much time to fly next week any way.

Next up will be the instrument panel. I'm still waiting for a monitor to be delivered for my daytime job. If that's in I can switch with my current monitor, which will then be used for the instruments (Air manager based).

Today I need to wait for my cellar floor to dry, so I decided to spend some time in additional software to Flight Simulator. I always have some difficulty to find my way taxiing on the airports, so I went on the look out for some help there.

To my surprise I found [EFASS](https://www.froom.de/), an *amazing* piece of software, free and all! Another one of those gems that I found while digging into the world of sims.

One downside though is that running FUIPC, EFASS and FlightSimulator has some effect on the performance of my PC. I already anticipated that I would need some additional PC power, and gathered some of my old stuff lying around.

On opening the machine I found that it didn't have a lot of memory. Back in the old days apparently this was good enough ;-)

Luckily I have some other old machines and was able to get some of those old DDR2 memory banks, so this machine will have a bit more decent performance.

Also, a dear friend donated a 250Gb SSD he had lying around, so hopefully the old girl can run EFASS for me. Now it's just a small matter of getting Windows 10 installed. During that process my USB drive went kaput, so need to juggle a bit with other bits and pieces. Anyway, I had some time available while another USB drive is being created as a boot devices for Windows 7 to write this post. It's almost done, so that's the update for today.

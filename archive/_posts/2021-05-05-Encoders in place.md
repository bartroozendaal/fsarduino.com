The encoders are in place. There is one problem though: the bottom ones touch the bezel of the display. I can either recreate the whole lot, moving the holes for the encoders a bit to the top, create two alternative places, filling the holes that I cannot use, or remove the bezel of the display.

Since I'm also not happy with the paintjob, I am considering to apply some black foil to make things look better. And that will cover up the 'wrong' holes. That might be the best option. Also, the buttons for the clock are too deep and touch the screen, so I need to get some alternate buttons for that.

So, not quite there yet. I've aligned two instruments (sort of) to give you an idea of the end result. I think a good night's sleep will help

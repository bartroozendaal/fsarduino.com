After some flying, I just wasn't happy with the height of the panel. Also, I was annoyed that the screen and radio panel didn't fit well. Knowing myself a bit, I already purchased an extra piece of wood, so I created a new version of the panel. This one came out much better. Practice makes perfect (or at least, better ;-))

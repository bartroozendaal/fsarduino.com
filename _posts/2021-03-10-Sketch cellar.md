After quite some thinking on what I should do, I decided to to for a simple approach. This is my first cockpit and I don't want to overreach. I'm a novice builder, so let's take it slow. I can always upgrade later.

I decided to start building something like the image below. I took the time to learn how to work with SketchUp. A bit of a learning curve, but once you understand the tool a bit, it gets easier. Anyways, I'll start with this this week, or the weekend at the latest.

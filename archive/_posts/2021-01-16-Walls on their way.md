Step 1 of the walls is done. The woodwork for the first wall is in place. Also I changed the lighting for a much brighter 50W LED light, so no more hot old, fashioned light downstairs.

The walls are very strong though, too strong for my current drills. I ordered some new ones, to be picked up on Monday. So, tomorrow I will focus on the electricity. If there is a lesson learned in life: one can never have enough wall plugs ;-)

I decided against renewing the ceiling. It is good as it is. Too much work and trouble, for only 2 cms more height or so. It is still 'just' a cellar, right?

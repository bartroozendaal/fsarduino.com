Today I didn't feel like working on the cellar. Yesterday I completed most of the electricity, so that is almost done.

I spent some time on the software, further investigating the integration with Air Manager. I tried to get one Arduino working with two potentiometers and a display, to change the radio frequency. That wasn't too difficult, so I'm pretty confident that will work out.

I will probably spend some time on creating a temporary radio panel. The wiring of the jump boards, and specifically the connections to the potentiometers, are not really stable. And, it would be nice to have something a bit sturdy in case I want to do some flying. I will probably have some problems in getting the right material for the wall (Covid and all), so this weekend I will take it nice and easy and finish the preparation of the walls. We'll see; I haven't made up my mind about that yet.

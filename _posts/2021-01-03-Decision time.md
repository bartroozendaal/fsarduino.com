After some thinking I decided against building the complete software stack from scratch. It is just too much work which will take time and I don't want that time taken away from the flying experience. I know that I can build software and don't have to practice on that anymore ;-)

I'm focussing on building the cockpit for the time being. I might revisit the plan when the cockpit is done, but I will have my hands full at the hardware part of it all.

For the software I will probably use Air Manager. I will need that for the instruments anyway and it also offers some sort of integration with Arduino for hardware buttons et cetera.

I've investigated [FCUIPC](http://fsuipc.com/) today. It works really well and got it running in no time. I will spend a bit of time on it still, just to get the experience.

I received my ordered [Dremmel Workstation](https://www.dremeleurope.com/nl/nl/dremel%C2%AEworkstation-277-ocs-p/) and [milling bits](https://www.dremeleurope.com/nl/nl/dremel%C2%AEmultifunctionelefrezenset-688-ocs-p/) yesterday, so I'm ready to build my first proper hardware enclosure. It will be a radio panel that I can put on my desk to handle the radio frequencies, something the honest bothers me very much doing with a mouse in Flight Simulator. It will give me some experience in building a more complete hardware set up.

Next two weeks will be dedicated to the floor in my cellar. Not much else will be going on, apart from flying and learning [VATSIM](https://www.vatsim.net/).

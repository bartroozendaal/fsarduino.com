I'm done preparing the walls for the plasterboards to be mounted. I hope I can get some delivered in this Covid time; most delivery services are postponed. Let's see if I can pull some strings with some friends in the industry.

I still have a Sur40 PixelSense as a left over from previous business. It is a bit loud, and it will not run FlightSimulator I imagine, but I can also use it as an external monitor. I plan to use this as my main screen for my flying computer. Hopefully it will give a nice result. Otherwise, I will go hunt for a secondhand tv. The side screens will follow later....

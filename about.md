Time for an update on the about page. For now, I will not build another integration package. I will use Air Manager and focus on building the cockpit. Depending on my experiences with Air Manager I may or may not pick up the software part of this. I will build panels using Arduino's with buttons, switches, et cetera, to make the cockpit more real (and also because I really hate setting frequencies using a mouse). So, for the time being, this is about building the cockpit and learning how to fly.

~~The project creates an interface between an Arduino and Flight Simulator 2020. I'm focusing on an Arduino Uno and will be using simconnect to connect to Flight Simulator 2020.~~

There is/used to be a library link2fs but it seems old and no longer supported. In fact, I couldn't access the pages that go with it anymore. From the videos it looks like it was built beginning of 2000 or something like that.

~~I will build this software in the next months or so. I'm also building parts for a cockpit, and, because I want to be flying too, I will use Air Manager in the mean time to connect my Arduino (unless I'm real quick ;-)).~~

Air manager looks like a super app, but delivers too much (can that be?) for me. I want to connect to FS2020, but build my own panels.

To be open and transparent: I have a full time job, also have a significant project on the side already, so I'm unsure how much time I can spend on it. No promises yet, but having defined sprints of 3 months, it will give you some idea on my ideas about that.

This is also my first open source project, so let's see how this goes. Please, don't depend on anything I deliver before I label it v1.0. If I decide to do so, I'll commit on supporting it for some time at least. It might die during the process though.

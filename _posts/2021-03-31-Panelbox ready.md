Ok, it is not yet at the level I will finally want to have it, but the first panelbox is done.

I know there is a short circuit somewhere if I shake the box a bit. My solution for now is: don't shake it ;-)

I will integrate it with AirManager and use it to fly around a bit. I do have a radio panel, but the top part of this will double as that. I did end up buying an Arduino Mega2560 clone, which has plenty of pins. I still have many available, so maybe I will extend it later on. For now, the switches and rotary encoders will help me manage the most crucial equipment in a Cessna 172 (or similar).

It was a bit of a struggle and journey to get to this first bit of hardware, but I'm satisfied I can call this one done.

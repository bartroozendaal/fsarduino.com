Today I created the first version of the panel, with the instrument screen and the radio panel in it. It makes a huge difference to have the radio panel fixed and steady. A bit of pressure doesn't tumble it over.

 I will use this setup for a bit, to check if the dimensions work for me. At first sight, I think I need to trim a bit of the top of the bottom, but I'll hold back with that for now. Let's first experience it a bit. I will also think about the side screens a bit. Let's imagine what it would be like when they are there.

Update: after messing around whole day with this old stuff, it simply is too old. Won't run Windows 10, or 8 even. And, since Windows 7 is no longer supported, all this old stuff is going to be binned. I still have a Samsung table that I got at a Microsoft Build event when Windows 8 was launched. The power adapter is broken, so I ordered another one, so hopefully that can get me EFASS running.
